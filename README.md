# Rol de Andaluc√≠a

## Description

This repository contains the web service that can be found at https://www.rol-andalucia.herokuapp.com, and serves as the main hub for my current-day Dungeons and Dragons campaigns.

### Current features

- Magic and nonmagical item list and description
- Character class description and ability list
- Magic spell list and description 
- Character sheet displayer
- Appointment manager to settle dates for the next session
- Character list with ability to claim it for one-shot sessions
- A backend for a Unity-based Android mockup that allows for virtual "phones" to be handed out to players so they can investigate NPC conversations and emails in game.
- A Telegram bot that can announce important events to groups
- An unhealthy amount of puns and silly humour
- Chaos code due to the platform having been developed solo and as a testing ground for other projects

### Planned features

- Interactive character sheets
- Actual list views that do not use the Django administrator views
- Clean up and refactor code so it isn't as much of a pain
- Create views for users to be able to suggest new items and spells to the platform, along with moderation for admins
- Full API access to use items and spells in other applications
- Even more dubious humour
